# 42piscine_0224

Intro for collaborators 
-----------------------
About the project 42piscine_0224 by kambarg (Gaukhar Kambarbaeva). This repository contains my draft works for the tasks I got during Feb 2024 Piscine in 42 Abu Dhabi coding school.
My git repository has main branch as default and 
it is the base. I am going to push code in main 
only after evaluation done by collaborators. Evaluations aka 'pull requests' 
in git are created in branches other than main (i.e. c05, c08).

Quick start guide
-----------------

Create your local copy of my git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kambarg/42piscine_0224.git
```
Get updates from the github to your local copy if there are any:
```
git pull
```
Change branch:
```
git checkout <branch name>
```
Add you code:
```
git add <file name>
```
Commit: 
```
git commit -m <commit message>
```
**!!! Before git push setup correct user name!!!**

Setup user name:
```
git config --global --edit
git config -l

Push to branch:
```
