# 42piscine_0224

Intro for collaborators 
-----------------------
of the project 42piscine_0224 by kambarg (Gaukhar Kambarbaeva):
My git repository has main branch as default and 
it is the base. I am going to push code in main 
only after evaluation. Evaluations aka pull requests 
in git are created in branches other than main (i.e. c05).

Quick start guide
-----------------

Git clone:
git clone https://github.com/kambarg/42piscine_0224.git

Change branch:
git checkout "branch name"

Add you code:
git add "file name"

Commit: 
git commit -m "commit message"

!!! Before git push setup correct user name!!!
Setup user name:
git config --global --edit
git config -l

Push to branch:
git push origin "branch name"

!!! Currently merging to main is blocked purposely!!!
Merge branch to main:
squash and merge
