# 42piscine_0224

Intro for collaborators 
-----------------------
About the project 42piscine_0224 by kambarg (Gaukhar Kambarbaeva). This repository contains my draft works of 42 Abu Dhabi coding school tasks.  
My git repository has main branch as default and 
it is the base. I am going to push code in main 
only after evaluation. Evaluations aka pull requests 
in git are created in branches other than main (i.e. c05, c08, libft).

Quick start guide
-----------------

Create your local copy of my git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kambarg/42piscine_0224.git
```
Update your local copy (if you created it a while ago):
```
git pull
```
Change branch:
```
git checkout <branch name>
```
Add you code:
```
git add <file name>
```
Commit: 
```
git commit -m <commit message>
```
**!!! Before git push setup correct user name!!!**

Setup user name:
```
git config --global --edit
git config -l
```
Push to branch:
```
git push origin <branch name>
```
**!!! Currently merging to main is blocked purposely!!!**

Merge branch to main:
```
squash and merge
```
